# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page
A really enjoyable yet challenging project and my first built largely unaided by tutorials. It was a project that really helped develop my understanding of a range of front-end skills. These include: 

1. The use of CSS Flexbox for positioning elements. 
2. Recreating a website from a mockup design - ensuring it is as close to pixel perfect as possible. 
3. The use of media queries to make the website responsive for all screen sizes. 
4. Considering whether to use pixels, percentages or rems in order to make any responsive changes easier. 

While I'm largely happy with the outcome of this website, there were areas I found particularly challenging. These are: 

- Having issues with the structure of the Hero section when making the website responsive to mobile screens. While the images and structure look great on desktop view, any resizing to smaller screens seems to expand the images so that they begin to impede on other elements on the screen. 

Areas to improve: 

1. Consider the use of using the CSS Grid system on another project, so that I have experience of using both Flexbox and the Grid system.
2. Research tips on resizing images when making them responsive. 
3. Research pseudo elements ::before and ::after, as I'm unsure of when they're beneficial to use.
4. Research how to make an overlay using javascript.
